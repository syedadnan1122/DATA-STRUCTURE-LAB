Question Statement
Task Title: Loading and Displaying IP Addresses Using a Doubly Linked List in C++

Problem Description: You are provided with a text file named ips.txt that contains 15 IP addresses separated by commas (,). Your task is to write a C++ program that performs the following operations using a doubly linked list (without using STL containers like std::list):

Read all IP addresses from the file ips.txt.
Insert each IP address into a doubly linked list such that each node stores one IP address.
Traverse and display the list in forward direction (from head to tail).
Traverse and display the list in reverse direction (from tail to head).
Ensure proper memory management by freeing all nodes at the end of the program.
File Format:

File name: ips.txt

Content example (single line):

192.168.1.10,10.0.0.5,172.16.0.1,203.0.113.5,198.51.100.23,8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4,192.0.2.45,10.10.10.10,172.20.14.2,52.214.10.7,34.102.136.180,185.199.108.153,13.35.66.1,44.240.20.10
Expected Output Example:

Forward traversal:
192.168.1.10 -> 10.0.0.5 -> 172.16.0.1 -> ... -> 44.240.20.10

Backward traversal:
44.240.20.10 -> 13.35.66.1 -> ... -> 192.168.1.10
Instructions:

Define a Node structure with ip, prev, and next members.
Implement functions for inserting, displaying (forward & backward), and freeing nodes.
Demonstrate your understanding of file handling, string tokenization, and linked list traversal in C++.
